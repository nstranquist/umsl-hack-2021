### Topics Considering

- 1. Fake Information / Disinformation
Give data from social media, apis, etc(??) a score based on its accuracy, biases, ...

- 5. Issues facing people in adjusting to dramatic life-changes (e.g., pandemics, climate change)
Could try to find a good data feed / api to get events as they come up, then evaluate them using the fake information model

- 3. Racial, gender, and other types of biases in AI
... need more information

... More ideas?
